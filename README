XBee Term Net
Copyright (C) 2014 Joel Maslak

This code allows you to build an XBee terminal network using Digi XBee
modules.  This code only works with Series 2 or 2.5 modules, and has
only been tested in ZigBee mode.

There are four roles in this network:

 Coordinator - This is both the ZigBee "coordinator" and the master
               "hub" for the message switching.  This XBee must be
               in API mode.

 Terminal    - Essentially "dumb terminal" remote nodes that can
               access the CUI and initiate connections to other
               nodes.  These XBees must be in transparent mode.

 Console     - These are "server" nodes, I.E. connections to a
               host (or router, switch, etc) that only receives
               connections.  These XBees also must be in
               transparent mode.

 Unknown     - All other XBees are in "unknown" mode.  They can 
               initiate connections as terminals can, but some
               functionality won't work.  This is to allow other
               Zigbee devices on the same network.

There is an automatic network discovery process that builds a list
of remote ZigBee nodes and their roles.  This process relies on the
"NODE IDENTIFICATION" (AT NI) string on each node.  Theis string
should consist of two words (make sure you don't have leading
spaces - the XCTU-NG GUI likes to add one!), the first one in all
upper case should be COORDINATOR, TERMINAL, or CONSOLE, while the
second one is case-insensitive and should be a unique hostname of
the node.

You must configure the XBees with any appropriate security, PAN,
and general network configuration that is required for the system
to properly function.  This is outside of the scope of this
document.
